        <h2>About Independence Day</h2>
        <p>
            Independence Day of India is celebrated every year on <strong>15th August</strong> to mark the nation's freedom from British rule in 1947. On this day, the Indian Independence Act 1947 came into effect, transferring legislative sovereignty from the United Kingdom to the Indian Constituent Assembly.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
        <p>
            India attained independence after a sustained nonviolent resistance movement led chiefly by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. The partition of British India into India and Pakistan also coincided with independence, accompanied by significant challenges and upheaval. The first Independence Day flag hoisting was done by Jawaharlal Nehru at the Red Fort in Delhi on August 15, 1947.

        <h3>Celebrations</h3>
        <p>
            Independence Day is a national holiday celebrated throughout India with flag hoisting ceremonies, parades, cultural events, and patriotic programs. The Prime Minister hoists the national flag at the Red Fort in Delhi and delivers a nationally televised speech. Other states observe their own celebrations with local governors or chief ministers raising the flag. Traditional activities include singing the national anthem and kite flying.
